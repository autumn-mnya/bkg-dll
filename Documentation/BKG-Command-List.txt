- <BKE - BacKGround Enable
Enable <BKG layer W. Layer 0 is the first <BKG layer. -- Doesn't do anything if <BKG wasn't used!
Arguments: 1 [<BKEwwww] [layer]

- <BKD - BacKGround Disable
Disable <BKG layer W. Layer 0 is the first <BKG layer. -- Doesn't do anything if <BKG wasn't used!
Arguments: 1 [<BKDwwww] [layer]

- <BKG - BacKGround
Load Background yaml file from data/bkg. -- End the text string with a $ so the game knows to stop reading the text.
Arguments: 1 [<BKGstring$] [background$]
Example: <BKGbkMoon$
( The above will load bkMoon.yaml )

Note: Older versions of the "Autumns Various Additions" dll used txt files for BKG, but now it uses yamls for easier readability.

# BKG Readme #

<BKG is a massive hack that can change how you create backgrounds in Cave Story.

It's incredibly complex though, as it has many moving parts. I'll try to explain most of them here!

<BKG loads a yaml file from the "data/bkg" folder. This yaml file contains the name of the background you want to display, and all of the layers you want your background to have.
You can see the "CustomTSC_BKG_Example.yaml" files for both an example of a <BKG yaml file, and also the format of understanding which values do what.

Read "CustomTSC_BKG_Explanation.txt" for more info on <BKG itself.

- <BKP - BacKGround Parameter
Set <BKG parameter X for layer W to value Y. Layer 0 is the first <BKG layer.
Arguments: 3 [<BKPwwww:xxxx:yyyy] [layer:parameter:value]
Example <BKP0000:0008:0008
